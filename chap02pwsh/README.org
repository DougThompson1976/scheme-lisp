* Scheme interpreter written in PowerShell
This is a small interpreter written in PowerShell.  It's really minimalistic.  It has some features which are not very common in Scheme interpreters:
  * dynamic functions and variables
  * exceptions which crash the whole program.  I call them /crashers/
  
You can see examples in the ~tests~ directory.
