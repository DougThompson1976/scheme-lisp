Exercises for Lisp In Small Pieces
So, here are exercises I make for the Lisp In Small Pieces book.  I try to do
different versions of the interpreter in different languages, because it is said
in the book that the best way to learn is to reimplement the program multiple
times.  And also, in order to avoid recycling and copy-pasting the code I wrote
in previous versions, I do every version in a different programming language.
It also allows me to explore a previously unknown language.
