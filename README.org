/Exercises for Lisp In Small Pieces/

So, here are exercises I make for the Lisp In Small Pieces book.  I try to do
different versions of the interpreter in different languages, because it is said
in the book that the best way to learn is to reimplement the program multiple
times.  And also, in order to avoid recycling and copy-pasting the code I wrote
in previous versions, I do every version in a different programming language.
It also allows me to explore a previously unknown language.

So far this is what has been done and what will follow:
 * chapter 01 in Kotlin
 * chapter 02 in PowerShell
 * chapter 03 will be in Swift (not sure yet)
 * chapter 04 will be in PL/M (not sure yet)

If you have a suggestion for a language I should explore, please let me know!
